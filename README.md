## PSPDFKit for Salesforce Integration

PSPDFKit for Salesforce integration uses PSPDFKit for Web Standalone as a [static resource][]. When the integration is deployed to a Salesforce org, the static resources are automatically created. The static resources are then used to load the PSPDFKit for Web Standalone library in the Salesforce org.

PSPDFKit for Salesforce shares the same APIs as PSPDFKit for Web Standalone, so please use the web documentation when customizing your Salesforce application.

## Getting Started

To get started, youâ€™ll need to:

- Set up a [Salesforce Developer Edition account][developer account]
- Install [Salesforce CLI][]
- The [latest stable version of Node.js][node.js].
- A package manager compatible with [npm][about-npm]. This guide contains usage examples for the [npm client][npm-client]. The npm client is installed with Node.js by default.

## Deploying the Package

To deploy the PSPDFKit package to your Salesforce org, follow these steps:

1. Download the [PSPDFKit for Salesforce project][repo] from GitHub, and then unpack the ZIP file.

Alternatively, run the following terminal command to clone the [PSPDFKit Salesforce repository][repo] from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PSPDFKit/salesforce.git
```

2. Navigate to the `salesforce` directory and run the following commands to install the dependencies and log in to your Salesforce org:

```bash
npm install

sfdx force:auth:web:login --setalias vscodeOrg --instanceurl https://login.salesforce.com --setdefaultusername
```

3. In the browser window that opens, log in to your Salesforce org, and authorize Salesforce CLI.
