# Nutrient Salesforce SDK Integration

## Integrate into a New Salesforce Project as a Lightning Web Component

Nutrient Salesforce SDK enables you to open PDF, JPG, PNG, and TIFF files inside Salesforce. This unlocks the full functionality of Nutrient Web SDK in Salesforce, including PDF generation, redaction, and signatures.

This README explains how to integrate Nutrient Web SDK into a new Salesforce project. The integration works as a [Lightning web component (LWC)][lwc] that you can add to any Salesforce organization.

For more information on integrating Nutrient Web SDK into an existing Salesforce project, see the [Nutrient Salesforce SDK documentation][salesforce docs].

Nutrient Salesforce SDK shares the same APIs as Nutrient Web SDK Standalone. For more information on customizing your Salesforce application, see the [Nutrient Web SDK Standalone documentation][web docs].

## Requirements

Before continuing, perform all of the following actions:

- Set up a [Salesforce Developer Edition account][developer].
- Install the [Salesforce CLI][].
- Install the [latest stable version of Node.js][node.js].
- Install a package manager compatible with [npm][about-npm]. This README contains usage examples for the [npm client][npm-client], which is installed with Node.js by default.

## Deploying the Package

To deploy the Nutrient Web SDK package to your Salesforce organization, follow these steps.

1. Download the [Nutrient Salesforce SDK project][zip] from GitHub, and then unpack the ZIP file.

   Alternatively, run the following terminal command to clone the [Nutrient Salesforce SDK repository][repo] from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PSPDFKit/salesforce.git
   ```

2. In the terminal, go to the Nutrient Salesforce SDK project folder and run the following command to install the Nutrient Web SDK npm module.

   Use the following code for npm:

   ```npm
   npm install
   ```

   Use the following code for Yarn:

   ```yarn
   yarn install
   ```

3. The Nutrient Salesforce SDK integration example now makes use of the Nutrient Web SDK version available from our CDN at https://cdn.cloud.pspdfkit.com/pspdfkit-web, which means it's no longer limited by Salesforce's upload assets size 5MB limit.

In order to set the Nutrient Web SDK version you want to use, open `./force-app/main/default/pages/Nutrient_InitNutrient.page` and edit the line 7 to reflect the Nutrient Web SDK version. For example, in order to use version 1.0.0, you should change the URL pointing to the CDN to:

    ```html
    <script src="https://cdn.cloud.pspdfkit.com/pspdfkit-web@1.0.0/nutrient-viewer.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    ```

    You can find the latest version of Nutrient Web SDK in the [Nutrient Web SDK changelog](https://www.nutrient.io/changelog/web/).

4. Run the following command in the terminal to start the Salesforce authentication process:

   ```bash
   sfdx force:auth:web:login --setalias mySalesforceOrg --instanceurl https://login.salesforce.com --setdefaultusername
   ```

5. In the browser window that opens, log in to your Salesforce organization and authorize the Salesforce CLI.

6. In the terminal, run the following command from the Nutrient Salesforce SDK project’s root folder:

   ```bash
   sfdx force:source:deploy -x manifest/package.xml
   ```

## Enabling Users to Use Nutrient Web SDK

To enable users of your Salesforce organization to use Nutrient Web SDK, follow these steps.

1. In Salesforce, go to **Users** > **Permission Sets**.

2. Find **Nutrient Admin Access** in the list and click it.

3. Click **Manage Assignments**.

4. Click **Add Assignment**.

5. Select the users you want to authorize to use Nutrient.

6. Click **Next**, and then click **Assign**.

## Changing the Security Settings

Nutrient Salesforce SDK requires Lightning Locker to protect Lightning web components, but Salesforce uses Lightning Web Security by default. To change the default security settings, follow these steps.

1. In Salesforce, go to **Security** > **Session Settings**.

2. Deselect **Use Lightning Web Security for Lightning web components**.

3. Scroll down and click **Save**.
